<br><br> <h1>Process</h1>


  <h2>The Goal</h2>
    <p> 1. Create a typeface using HTML and CSS that explores what it means to make a typeface for the screen versus the printed page.
        Express a message using the formal qualities of the typeface.<br>
        2. Create a website that uses this font as the primary means of communication that
        supports your message. </P>

    <p> My project should:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>support a clear message</li>
      <li>be interactive or explore internet related tropes</li>
      <li>affect the user emotionally or intellectually through the interaction </li>
      <li>be visually interesting & beautiful </li>
      <li>be built with css & jquery </li>
    </ul>


  <h2>Brainstorming Messages</h2>

  <h3> Message 1: The internet is altering our perception of time<h3>

    <p> <i>As time passes, our actions leave a trail of consequences whether we are paying attention or not. The internet has made us more present-hedonistic. We tend to ignore the future consequences of our behavior. We are less patient and more impulsive.
    </i></P>

    <p> Interaction 1: the faster that the user types, the less legible the text appears.  This forces the audience to think more about what they are posting.
      emotion evoked - frustration
    </P>

    <p> Interaction 2: the user can only type one letter at a time and can never see the whole message, somehow your past narrow decisions actions affect your future.
      emotion evoked - frustration
    </P>

    <p> Interaction 3: the user cannot undo what they have typed and must endure the consequences of their quick, thoughtless typing.
      emotion evoked - frustration. challenges our habit and ability to editing text on the internet. And draws attention to how much that we do edit.
    </P>


  <h3> Message 2: The internet is altering our perception of ourselves <h3>
    <p><i> The internet makes us very self-aware. We carefully craft our internet selves. </i></P>
    <p> Interaction 1: the user is instructed to type in thier name. The longer that they stay on the page, the more
        distorted the text becomes, until it is completely unreadable.
    </P>
    <p>  </P>


  <h3> Message 3: The anonymity of internet is altering our ideas of privacy <h3>
    <p><i> We willingly let people into our lives through social media. How much of the content on the internet can
      we actually trust if anyone can post at any time?</i></P>

    <p> Interaction 1: the website records as much information that it can about the user while they are on the s-top-white
        and displays it on the screen. </p>

    <p>  Interaction 2: the user can type in some text and sumbit it to the page. It then dissolves and
        disappears. Every once and a while, text will fade into focus.
    </P>
