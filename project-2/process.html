<br><br> <h1> Process </h1>


<h2>The Goal</h2>
  <p> 1. Create a typeface using HTML and CSS that explores what it means to make a typeface for the screen versus the printed page.
      Express a message using the formal qualities of the typeface.<br>
      2. Create a website that uses this font as the primary means of communication that
      supports your message. </P>

<p> My project should:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the typeface and the website should support a clear message</li>
    <li>be interactive or explore internet realtes tropes</li>
    <li>affect the user emotionally or intellectually through the interaction  </li>
    <li>the typeface should be visually interesting beautiful </li>
    <li>form built with css, interactivity created with jquery </li>

  </ul>


<h2>Brainstorming Concepts</h2>

<h3> 1. Light Control - Winning Idea <h3>

  <p> The role that light plays at French Roast is striking. Mismatched lighting fixtures and little candles in the evening
    give the place a nice ambiance. The lighting at French Roast changes drastically throughout the day. I want to explore how
    the time of day affects the function of the space.The user will control the light coming from a chandelier on the screen and
    will be able to symbolically change the time of day. </P>

<p> Icons will sit on the screen with the chandelier and change slightly depending on the time of day.
    If the user clicks on one, a screen will appear with more information about what is happening in the restaurant
    in that regard at that time.For example, if the chandelier is all lit all the way and it's sorrounded by darkness,
    then it might be 12am and the user would be able to find out how many people are usually in the
    restaurant at that time and what kind of people there are. </P>

  <h3> 2. Unusual Perspectives <h3>
    <p> What would it be like to experience a space from the perspective of different objects that make up the space?
        What does your chair have to say about the way you experience a space?
        If objects were alive which object would like the way that we treat them and which objects would hate us?</P>

  <p> This would probably be set up as an lay out of simple illustrated objects as the home page and the user could click
      on an object and get it's side of the story. </P>

  <h3> 3. Isolated Senses <h3>
    <p> I would explore different functions of a space by isolating different senses so that the user only focuses on one
      sense for the entire experience. So the intro screen would be icons of the senses: sight or hearing.
    </P>

    <p> The user would pick one and then they would experience a narrative of the space that only uses one.
      In a way they would be experiencing what it would be like to be blind or deaf. Both of the narratives would be time based -
      a silent video and a audio recording. </P>

  <h3> 4. Abstracted Details <h3>
    <p> I thought it would be fun to play around with a personâ€™s memory of a space. Our memories tend to become more and more abstracted
       each time we remember it. I thought it would be interesting to see what different ways that I could abstract the experience of
       being in a space.The home page might be just a bunch of images of the space, and of people interacting with the space.
    </P>

    <p> When the user clicks on an image, it begins to abstract and with each click it would become more and more unrecognizable.   </P>

  <h3> 5. Beats <h3>
    <p> French Roast is activated by the customers that come in. The business goes up and down during the day and at different
        times of the week. But the weather also affects the mood and the atmosphere inside.
        I thought it might be interesting to create a website that described the current state of French Roast musically.
    </P>

    <p> The user would be able to control the day of the week and the time but the weather would be controlled by weather data online.
        So for example, on a sunny brunch morning, a very happy upbeat song would play.  While on a rainy night, it might be a slow
        depressing song.   </P>

        <h2>Early Drafts</h2>



          <br> <br><br><br> <h1> Lessons Learned </h1>
        <h2>Design</h2>
        <h3> 1. Everything should reflect your message.<h3>
          <p> Every part of a design communicates. Even the things that you don't to consider. After trying out a design that really
          didn't reflect the atmosphere of my space, I realized that I wasn't doing the experience of visiting French Roast justice. In
          my later designs, I focused on reflecting the chaotic, ecclectic feel that French Roast rocks. I think that the final design does
          a much better job of giving the viewer a taste of what a visit to French Roast is really like. </P><br>

        <h3> 2. The more complete your design is in Sketch, the easier it will be to excecute later. <h3>
          <p> As someone who normally works through creative decisions during the execution process, this is something that
              I'm going have to train myself to do. By separating the design and the excecution, you can fully focus on just one, preventing
              frustration and saving time. And that sounds great. </P><br>

        <h2>Code</h2>
        <h3> 1. Divs are wonderful, useful things. <h3>
          <p> They make everything nice and neat.  </P>

        <h3> 2. Write clean, organized code. <h3>
          <p> Again, this is something that I'm going to have to work on because neatness does not come naturally to me.
             But if I get into a habit, writing nice code will enormously benefit me. Clean code is much easier to work with.   </P>
