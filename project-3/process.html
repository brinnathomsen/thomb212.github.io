<h1>Process</h1>


  <h2>The Goal</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a webpage that acts as a poem generator</li>
      <li>Use chance to create a changing poem</li>
      <li>Use event states to make the webpage change over time </li> </ol>

  <h2>Objectives</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>generate a poem that makes sense</li>
      <li>be interactive</li>
      <li>affect the user emotionally or intellectually through the interaction </li>
      <li>be visually interesting & beautiful </li>
    </ul>


  <h2>Brainstorming a Concept</h2>

    <ul>
      <li> Change the mood of the poem based on the users interactions with it, like a person*
      </li>

      <li> Alliterative poem that the user can control by clicking on individual letters to change the first
      </li>

      <li> Whole page is filled with poem (but it's so small it forms more of a pattern) but the user hovers over areas to magnify them and enjoy only small parts of it at a time.
      </li>

      <li> Generated newspaper/site
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Developing the Concept</h2>
    <p> For this project, I've decided to create a webpage that generates a note to the user based on how the user is interacting with the site. I will portray the site's
      moods as if it was a human, hopefully making the user reflect on the 'relationship' that we have with the internet.</P>

    <li> The first question to consider is what would a webpage 'feel' about different interactions with it?</li>
    <li>  What would make a webpage happy, sad, angry, excited? </li>


<p> The site will seem 'happy' when...</p>




<p> The site will seem 'excited' when...</p>

<p> The site will seem 'sad' when...</p>

<li> Since the internet is meant to help us, I can only assume that a webpage would be annoyed or sad if we ignored it</li>

<p> The site will seem 'angry/hostile' when...</p>
